                            I am Hitansh Shah. I am an undergradudate at IIT Varanasi (BHU) pursuing Mathematics and Computing
                            and I am expected to graduate in the year 2025.
                            <br/>
                            I was introduced to the world of programming in my freshman year of college.
                            I began to pursue various topics and areas of programming. I always try to learn new things and
                            keep experimenting around various fields/subfields to see what best fits my interest.
                            Apart from that, I <span style={{display: "inline-block", width: "20px", height: "25px"}}><span className={styles.heart}>‚ù§Ô∏è</span></span> contributing to open-source.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            I started off with web-development and I still love to create creative web-apps.
                            I learnt MERN stack as my first tech-stack for full stack development and then went
                            on to learn and work with various other tech-stacks like Django, python, NextJS etc.
                            <br/>
                            I am also very much interested in <span style={{fontWeight: "bold"}}>Web3</span> and would
                            love to collaborate on any blockchain related projects.
